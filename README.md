# PoliticsNLP

This ongoing proyect utilices NLP to analyze and model natural language data (opinions about either politic scenarios or other user's opinions on this scenarios).

This includes:

1. Pre processing and tokenization
2. Topic Modeling
3. Semantic Similarity
4. Sentiment Analysis
5. Predicting Models: predict which opinion is the most semantically similar to the selected one, among others.

All analysis were made using both shallow Machine Learning (LSA, LDA, TF-IDF) and Deep Learning (BERT) algorithms.
